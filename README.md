# Portfolio

Portfolio of projects I worked on both academically and professionally. 


## Project 1: [Supervised and Unspervised methods](https://github.com/sabrinasforza/Portfolio/blob/main/University_project_1_supervised_and_unsupervised_learning.ipynb/)
In this project, I explored gender differences among UK Tech Workers with respect to their mental health. After providing summary statistics, I explore the results of one unsupervised analysis method and one supervised analysis method and evaluate their performance.

## Project 2: [Predicting the popularity and the genre of songs using Regression and Classification](https://github.com/sabrinasforza/Portfolio/blob/main/University_project_2_regression_and_classification.ipynb/) 
In this group project, I used Spotify song characteristics to predict ratings and genre. The former was predicted using different regression methods while the latter was predicted using classification. 

## Project 3: [Neural Networks to predict student grades](https://github.com/sabrinasforza/Portfolio/blob/main/University_project_3_Neural_Networks.ipynb)
This group project constisted of building several ANNs to predict student performance based on previous grades using Keras Tensorflow. The models were: Perceptron, Feedforward NN, Wide and Deep NN, Wide and Deep NN with an embedding layer. 

## Project 4: [MSc Dissertation](https://github.com/sabrinasforza/Portfolio/blob/main/MSc%20dissertation.docx.pdf)
In my MSc dissertation, I analysed urban data on public transport availability to predict the incidence of Gender-Based Violence in Scotland using R on RStudio. 

## Project 5: [NatWest Hackathon](https://github.com/sabrinasforza/Portfolio/files/10098860/Hackathon_winning_proposal.pdf)

In November 2022, I attended the Data Science and Engineering conference organised by NatWest Group in Edinburgh. As part of the conference, I took part in a hackathon. The challenge was to create a personalised solution for NatWest's business customers using fictitious retail customer data. 
My team and I came up with a personalised dashboard to provide small businesses with insights on customer spending patterns. To do so, we built an unsupervised classification model based on customers' personal characteristics such as age and gender using AWS Sagemaker and AWS Data Wrangler, segmenting customers into personas. Businesses base their marketing decisions on each persona's spending habits to increase revenue. The solution was positively judged by NatWest senior leaders in Data & Analytics and was awarded first place.
