## Project 5: NatWest Hackathon

In November 2022, I attended the Data Science and Engineering conference organised by NatWest Group in Edinburgh. As part of the conference, I took part in a hackathon. The challenge was to create a personalised solution for NatWest's business customers using fictitious retail customer data. 
My team and I came up with a personalised dashboard to provide small businesses with insights on customer spending patterns. To do so, we built an unsupervised classification model based on customers' personal characteristics such as age and gender using AWS Sagemaker and AWS Data Wrangler, segmenting customers into personas. Businesses base their marketing decisions on each persona's spending habits to increase revenue. The solution was positively judged by NatWest senior leaders in Data & Analytics and was awarded first place.
